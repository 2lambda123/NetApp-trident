Trident is an officially supported NetApp project. That means you can reach out
to NetApp using any of the `standard mechanisms`_ and get the enterprise grade
support that you need.

There is also a vibrant public community of container users (including Trident
developers) on the #containers channel in `NetApp's Slack team`_. This is a
great place to ask general questions about the project and discuss related
topics with like-minded peers.
