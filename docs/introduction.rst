What is Trident?
################

Trident is a fully supported `open source project`_ maintained by `NetApp`_. It
has been designed from the ground up to help you meet the sophisticated
persistence demands of your containerized applications.

Through its support for popular container platforms like `Kubernetes`_ and
`Docker`_, Trident understands the natural and evolving languages of those
platforms, and translates requirements expressed or implied through them
into an automated and orchestrated response from the infrastructure.

Today, that infrastructure includes our `ONTAP`_
(AFF/FAS/Select/Cloud), `Element`_ (HCI/SolidFire), and `SANtricity`_ (E/EF-Series)
data management software. That list continues to grow.
