NetApp Products and Integrations with Kubernetes
************************************************

The NetApp portfolio of storage products integrates with many different aspects of a Kubernetes cluster, providing advanced storage capabilities which enhance the functionality, capability, performance, and availability of the Kubernetes deployment.


Trident
-------

NetApp Trident is a dynamic storage provisioner for the containers ecosystem. It provides the ability to create storage volumes for containerized applications managed by Docker and Kubernetes. Trident is a fully supported, open source project hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/netapp/trident>`_.
Trident works with the portfolio of NetApp storage platforms to deliver storage on-demand to applications according to policies defined by the administrator. When used with Kubernetes, Trident is deployed using native paradigms and provides persistent storage to all namespaces in the cluster.
For more information about Trident, visit `ThePub <http://netapp.io/containers>`_.


ONTAP
-----

ONTAP is NetAppâ€™s multiprotocol, unified storage operating system providing advanced data management capabilities for any application. ONTAP systems may have all-flash, hybrid, or all-HDD configurations and offer many different deployment models, including engineered hardware (FAS and AFF), white-box (ONTAP Select), and cloud-only (Cloud Volumes ONTAP). Trident supports all the above mentioned deployment models. 

Element OS
----------

Element OS enables the storage administrator to consolidate workloads by guaranteeing performance and enabling a simplified and streamlined storage footprint. Coupled with a full API to enable automation of all aspects of storage management, Element OS enables storage administrators to do more with less effort.

Trident supports all Element OS clusters, more information can be found at `Element Software <https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/element-os.aspx>`_.

NetApp HCI
----------

NetApp HCI simplifies the management and scale of the datacenter by automating routine tasks and enabling infrastructure administrators to focus on more important functions.

NetApp HCI is fully supported by Trident, which is able to provision and manage storage devices for containerized applications directly against the underlying HCI storage platform. For more information about NetApp HCI visit `NetApp HCI <https://www.netapp.com/us/products/converged-systems/hyper-converged-infrastructure.aspx>`_.

SANtricity
----------

The NetApp E and EF Series storage platforms, using the SANtricity operating system, provides robust storage that is highly available, performant, and capable of delivering storage services for applications at any scale.

Trident is able to create and manage SANtricity volumes across the portfolio of products.

For more information about SANtricity and the storage platforms which use it, see `SANtricity Software <https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/santricity-os.aspx>`_.
