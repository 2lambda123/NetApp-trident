Trident is a fully supported open source project maintained by [NetApp](https://www.netapp.com). It has been designed from the ground up to help you meet the sophisticated persistence demands of your containerized applications.

Through its support for popular container platforms like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Docker](https://docker.com), Trident understands the natural and evolving languages of those platforms, and translates requirements expressed or implied through them into an automated and orchestrated response from the infrastructure.

Today, that infrastructure includes our [ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/ontap.aspx) (AFF/FAS/Select/Cloud), [Element](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/element-os.aspx) (HCI/SolidFire), and [SANtricity](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/santricity-os.aspx) (E/EF-Series) data management software, as well as the [Azure NetApp Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/netapp/) service, [Cloud Volumes Service on Google Cloud](https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-gcp?utm_source=GitHub&utm_campaign=Trident) and the [Cloud Volumes Service on AWS](https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-service-for-aws?utm_source=GitHub&utm_campaign=Trident).

That list continues to grow.

Detailed documentation for Trident can be found on [Read the Docs](https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io).

Trident's support policy is outlined on [NetApp's Support site](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/version-support)
under the [Trident's Release and Support Lifecycle](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/trident-support) tab.
