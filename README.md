Trident is a fully supported open source project maintained by [NetApp](https://www.netapp.com). It has been designed
from the ground up to help you meet the sophisticated persistence demands of your containerized applications.

Through its support for popular container platforms like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and
[Docker](https://docker.com), Trident understands the natural and evolving languages of those platforms, and
translates requirements expressed or implied through them into an automated and orchestrated response from the
infrastructure.

Today, that infrastructure includes our [ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/ontap.aspx)
(AFF/FAS/Select/Cloud), [Element](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/element-os.aspx)
(HCI/SolidFire), and [SANtricity](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/santricity-os.aspx)
(E/EF-Series) data management software. That list continues to grow.

Detailed documentation for Trident can be found on [Read the Docs](https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io).
