# Trident

Trident is a fully supported open source project maintained by
[NetApp](https://www.netapp.com). It helps meet the sophisticated persistence
demands of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) applications by natively
integrating with its
[Persistent Volume framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
to seamlessly provision and manage volumes from systems running any
combination of NetAppâ€™s
[ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/ontap.aspx)
(AFF/FAS/Select/Cloud),
[Element](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/element-os.aspx)
(SolidFire), or
[SANtricity](https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-management-software/santricity-os.aspx)
(E/EF-Series) data management platforms.
